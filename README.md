# SVM
## implement Support vector mechine (SVM) on Iris dataset with different kernel
Comparison of different linear SVM classifiers on a 2D projection of the iris dataset. We only consider the first 2 features of this dataset:

- petal length
- petal width

This example shows how to plot the decision surface for four SVM classifiers with different kernels
